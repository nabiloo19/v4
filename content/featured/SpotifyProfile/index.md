The Google Developers Group in Addis [`(GDGAddis)`](https://www.gdgaddis.dev/) is a community of passionate developers, interested in all tech stack fields. That's what I shared when I wrote the SEO content of their landing page, as I am a tech-driven, open-source advocate of any community-focused projects.

I was lucky enough to lead the project in terms of developing the website as well as writing the content of the landing and routing pages.

My choice of [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) came from the fact that I am an open-source advocate, and as I am working in a community, that would push them to use such services and contribute back.

The User Experience is what I also focused on and that is demonstrated in the accessbility added such as PWA and the tech-driven content.
