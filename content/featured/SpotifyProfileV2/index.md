COVID19 hit the world, and Ethiopia was no exception. On top of that, the country was going through many hurdles internally, and that doubled with the pandemic.

I had the chance not to only write content to both the [website](https://covidet-app.netlify.app/), [admin's dashboard](pims-dashboard.netlify.app), and [mobile app](https://covidet64.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/05-05-2020/Covidet_v1.0.0-arm64-v8a.apk) (Content & UX Writing), but also had the chance to build and develop some components of the innovative intervention that eventually led to us winning several locally and internationally awards.
